When users create a home screen icon on iPhone (or any device), this icon should automatically show up. This requires: 1) Creating icon image files in multiple sizes (192x192, 512x512, apple-touch-icon), 2) Adding a manifest.json file for PWA support, 3) Adding appropriate meta tags to the HTML, 4) The icon design should be a simple pixel-art style running person that fits the app's theme",
